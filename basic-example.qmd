# Abstract

As a culturally enriching and health-promoting activity [@Kim2019; @Santarem2015], hiking has been popular among urban residents, particularly post-COVID-19 [@Griffiths2020]. Equitable access to natural environments significantly influences physiological, psychological, and immunological well-being [@Yin2023]. However, traditional accessibility metrics primarily emphasize spatial proximity while overlooking critical temporal constraints such as weekday evening availability, public transport schedules, and daylight hours. These hidden temporal barriers may disproportionately exclude marginalized groups (e.g., caregivers and shift workers) from accessing nearby trails, even in geographically compact regions.

To address these limitations, this study focuses on weekday evening accessibility during summer months when longer daylight and favorable weather provide enhanced opportunities for outdoor activities. We introduce a refined **Temporal Accessibility Index (TAI)** to evaluate trails reachable from urban centers on weekday evenings, emphasizing public transport connectivity.

Using Munich, Germany—a city with a dense working population and direct proximity to Alpine hiking areas—as a case study, we assess trail feasibility based on transit schedules, daylight availability, and trail duration. We analyze **32,953** trails from Wikiloc (<https://www.wikiloc.com>), a leading crowdsourced platform with over **14 million** global trails and **11.3 million** active users. Key variables are listed in Table @tbl-data. Trail lengths range from **0.0 m** to over **1,168,232 km**, with elevation gains/losses up to **135,216.9 m**, indicating large variation in physical demand and time requirements.

Preliminary analysis of hiking data is presented in Figures.  
A marked increase in participation is observed in 2020 and 2024 ( @fig-trails-a).  
The 2020 surge coincides with post-COVID-19, suggesting heightened interest in outdoor recreation following lockdowns and rising health awareness.  
The increase in 2024 follows the introduction of Germany’s €49 monthly public transportation ticket in 2023, which substantially lowered travel costs and improved access to natural areas.  

Seasonal patterns are also evident, with hiking activity peaking in spring and summer, likely driven by longer daylight hours and favorable weather conditions.  
Changes in trail usage patterns are shown in @fig-trails-b, where a growing preference for one-way routes—those with different start and end points—indicates increasing dependence on public transport.  
These findings highlight how public policy and mobility infrastructure shape outdoor recreational behavior.

# Conclusion

Prioritizing public transport–based evening access reveals policy-relevant levers for equitable nature access. Findings can inform urban and transit planning to support after-work outdoor opportunities without increasing car dependency.
